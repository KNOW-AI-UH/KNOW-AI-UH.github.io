The project aims at developing large-scale algorithms for highly-multilingual media monitoring that will produce reliable real-time alerts on an open set of event types indicating global threats—for example:
- pandemic outbreaks, 
- terror attacks, 
- socio-political unrest, 
- natural disasters, 
- etc.

The objectives of this project are two-fold. 
1. On one hand we pursue a highly timely and topical application: designing state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) for detecting events in the context of global social threats, with clear societal impacts. 
2. On the other hand, we explore fundamental problems in LLMs—in the context of this application; namely, model explainability, model confidence, and sustainability.

To achieve these goals, we leverage High Performance Computing (HPC) to build and refine LLM methodologies, and a critical mass of international collaboration, with collaborators who bring complementary expertise and resources.
