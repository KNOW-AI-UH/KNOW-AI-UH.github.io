## Research focus

1. We work on timely problems: building state-of-the-art models for analyzing and tracking global threats:
    - Analysis of propaganda and disinformation:
        - We organize [__SemEval 2025 Task 10: Multilingual Characterization and Extraction of Narratives from Online News__](https://propaganda.math.unipd.it/semeval2025task10/)
        - We organize [__Shared Task on: Detection and Classification of Persuasion Techniques in Slavic Languages__](https://bsnlp.cs.helsinki.fi/shared-task.html)
    - Tracking outbreaks of epidemics in global media:
        - Work in collaboration with [__European Commission's Joint Research Centre__](https://medisys.newsbrief.eu/medisys/helsinkiedition/en/home.html)
        - [__PULS__](https://puls.cs.helsinki.fi/) information extraction from text media.
2. We work on fundamental problems in LLMs — model explainability, confidence, and sustainability — please see Publications


### Detecting Propaganda and Persuasion Techniques in Media

Rapid advances in technology make possible the easy establishment of direct communication channels between producers and consumers of information.
This raises the potential to expose the latter to _deceptive_ content and _mass manipulation_.
Huge audiences are affected online, and major crisis events are subjected to the spread of harmful disinformation and propaganda.

We develop methods for supporting users in analyzing the media ecosystem, and characterizing the emerging manipulation attempts.
The goal is to learn about propaganda and disinformation methods, and how they produce harmful effects.


### Knowledge-Aware and Retrieval-Augmented Language Models

We develop algorithms for multilingual media monitoring that produce reliable real-time alerts on an open set of event types that indicate global threats — including:
- pandemic outbreaks,
- terrorist activity,
- socio-political unrest,
- human trafficking, arms smuggling,
- natural and man-made disasters.

LLMs offer unparalleled quality of analysis, but are trained on "legacy" data, which — by construction — is not up-to-date.  We explore how the LLM can draw on external knowledge bases and live up-to-date media streams.
To achieve these goals, we leverage High Performance Computing (HPC) to build and refine LLM methods, and a critical mass of international collaboration with collaborators who bring complementary expertise and resources.


###  AI-Enhanced Knowledge Management in Business
We aim at designing state-of-the-art LLMs for processing large collections of documents, with practical focus and clear societal or business impacts. The focus is in combining structured and unstructured data, i.e. internal company documents and knowledge bases that can be used to make a tailored application for a specific business.
